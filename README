                              -------------------

Authen::Ticket provides the framework for implementing a ticketing system 
for web authentication.  Both the client website and ticket server code 
can be constructed from Authen::Ticket.  The current version requires
cookies to operate correctly.

The framework allows for customization at all phases in the process.  This
includes not only the login screens, but the cookie creation and optional
digital signature algorithm as well.

The ticket signature code (Authen::Ticket::Signature) allows for
signature creation and verification of tickets as well as a handler to
provide a key server.

The Authen::Ticket::Server class will work with either CGI or CGI::WeT.  
With CGI::WeT installed, the pages presented will have a similar appearance 
to the rest of the website using CGI::WeT without modifying the sub-class
of Authen::Ticket::Server.  This is only true with CGI::WeT version 0.71
or greater.

The code is split into four components:

    Authen::Ticket             mod_perl handler for both server and client
    Authen::Ticket::Server     base ticket server code
    Authen::Ticket::Client     base ticket client code
    Authen::Ticket::Signature  base code for providing signed tickets

To install, simply type

     $ perl Makefile.PL
     $ make
     $ make install

The following module dependencies exist:

o Tickets must not expire during a POST.  This will cause all POST
  data to be lost.
