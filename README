                              -------------------

Authen::Ticket provides the framework for implementing a ticketing system 
for web authentication.  Both the client website and ticket server code 
can be constructed from Authen::Ticket.  The current version requires
cookies to operate correctly.

The framework allows for customization at all phases in the process.  This
includes not only the login screens, but the cookie creation and optional
digital signature algorithm as well.

The ticket signature code (Authen::Ticket::Signature) allows for
signature creation and verification of tickets as well as a handler to
provide a key server.

The code is split into four components:

    Authen::Ticket             mod_perl handler for both server and client
    Authen::Ticket::Server     base ticket server code
    Authen::Ticket::Client     base ticket client code
    Authen::Ticket::Signature  base code for providing signed tickets

To install, simply type

     $ perl Makefile.PL
     $ make
     $ make install

The Server/Client code requires the following modules:

     CGI
     CGI::Cookie
     MIME::Base64
     Carp

The mod_perl handler requires the following modules:

     Apache
     Apache::URI

The digital signature code requires the following modules:

     OpenSSL
     Apache::File

BUGS
----

o Tickets must not expire during a POST.  This will cause all POST
  data to tbe lost.

o Shared memory support is not robust enough.  Certain conditions
  can cause the server to enter an endless cycle of child destruction
  and creation.
